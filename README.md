# psychic-game

This is my psychic game that I put together.  I found this harder to be harder than expected and still for whatever reason, I can't connect my html to my JS.  I google fu'd and spoke to both TA's and peers.  I hope to find the culprit in office hours.  Either way, I'll get there. I just talked to Sasha who helped me with changing my classes to id's.  I'm going to keep at it during the weekend.
