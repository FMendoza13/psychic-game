# Psychic-Game

# Getting started
This is my psychic game that I put together.  The rules of the game is that the website will choose a random letter of the alphabet and the player will have 10 tries to guess which letter was chosen.  If they are able to guess which letter was chosen, the player wins.  If not by their tenth try, the player loses.  Enjoy!  

# Prerequisites
No need to install software. Just visit the website:

# Issues
I found this harder to be harder than expected and still for whatever reason, I can't connect my html to my JS.  I google fu'd and spoke to both TA's and peers.  I hope to find the culprit in office hours.  Either way, I'll get there. 

I just talked to Sasha who helped me with changing my classes to id's.  I'm going to keep at it during the weekend.
