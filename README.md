# Psychic-Game

# Getting started
This is my psychic game that I put together.  The rules of the game is that the website will choose a random letter of the alphabet and the player will have 10 tries to guess which letter was chosen.  If they are able to guess which letter was chosen, the player wins.  If not by their tenth try, the player loses.  Enjoy!  

# Prerequisites
No need to install software. Just visit the website:

# Installing
Whomever needs to see my code just needs a Visual Source Code program, along with an understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
